## Dataset

### fbin & ibin

All embedding data (base, query, learning) is stored in `.fbin` format. And all ground truth is strored in `.ibin` format.

```python
# .fbin format:
[num_vectors (uint32), vector_dim (uint32), vector_array (float32)]
# .ibin format:
[num_vectors (uint32), vector_dim (uint32), vector_array (int32)]
```

### fvecs & ivecs

The vector files are stored in `.fvecs` or `.bvecs` format, and the ground truth file is `.ivecs` format. The only difference between `.bvecs`, `.fvecs` and `.ivecs` files is the base type for the vector components, which is **unsigned char**, **float** or **int**, respectively. Each vector takes `4+d*4` bytes for `.fvecs` and `.ivecs` formats, and `4+d` bytes for `.bvecs` formats, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the vector.

By default, **SIFT** dataset uses this type to store data.

```python
# Each vector takes (4+d*4) bytes for .fvecs and .ivecs formats, d is dimension.
# .fvecs format and .ivecs format:
[(dim, vector), (dim, vector), ...]
```
